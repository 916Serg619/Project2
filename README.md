# Motivation

Planning a big event such as a wedding requires the coordination of vendors and guests. A wedding planner managing multiple events will benefit from having access to a database that contains all of the important information for every event they are managing. 

# Description

The app uses the following technologies:
* [Handlebars.js](https://handlebarsjs.com/) is used as the template engine.
* Backed by a [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database with a Sequelize ORM.
* Utilizes GET, POST, PUT and DELETE routes for retrieving, adding, changing and removing data.
* [Passport.js](http://www.passportjs.org/) authentication middleware for Node.js. 
* [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) for page animations.
