# Planner for Wedding Planners #
Wedding planners rejoice! This app offers users the ability to store important details for every event they're managing. A MySql database stores the following:

* Every couple's name and contact information;
* Event date and location; 
* Vendor contact information; and
* Guest contact information. 

## Motivation ##

Planning a big event such as a wedding requires the coordination of vendors and guests. A wedding planner managing multiple events will benefit from having access to a database that contains all of the important information for every event they are managing. 

## Description ##

The app uses the following technologies:
* [Handlebars.js](https://handlebarsjs.com/) is used as the template engine.
* Backed by a [MySQL] (https://www.mysql.com/) database with a Sequelize ORM.
* Utilize both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
* [Passport.js](http://www.passportjs.org/) authentication middleware for Node.js. 
* [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) for page animations.
